\begin{section}{Welcome!}
You are currently reading version 0.0.4 of the book, generated on \today using a DSI Prophet REV2 running OS 1.1.0.3. You are free to copy and adapt this book under the terms of the creative commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license. Now is the time to double check if there's no newer version of the book available at \url{https://github.com/shimpe/rev2/releases}.

This book was made possible by combining huge amounts of effort from very many people. Trying to trace back everyone who contributed to this book directly or indirectly is impossible. Yet some people deserve special mentioning: DSI Forum user Razmo was so kind as to post his analysis of the sysex structure of the REV2. DSI Forum user Gerry Havinga published a template on \url{https://gezz.eu/tutorials/} that can be used to concisely represent patch settings. Both their efforts form the fundaments on which this book is built.

To create this book also tons of free and open source technology was used: python (\url{https://www.python.org}) scripts to convert lists of nrpn numbers into code, supercollider (\url{https://https://supercollider.github.io/}) to interface with the DSI Prophet REV2 synth and to generate \LaTeX{} code, which in turn generates .pdf.

Creating this book would have been impossible if Dave Smith Instruments (\url{https://www.davesmithinstruments.com/}) hadn't made it possible to interface with their synthesizers so thoroughly. My heartfelt thanks go out to the preset sound designers who poured years of experience (and the odd bit of good old serendipity) into these presets, some of which can truly be considered mind-blowing (and others... well... perhaps less so). Of course even the best of patches would not blow any mind if they weren't executed by a superb synthesizer, for which we can only thank Dave Smith and his colleagues.

DSI does not officially endorse this book (the truth being told: most likely they aren't even aware it exists!). Any errors
in this book therefore are completely mine. \textbf{Use at your own risk - you get what you pay for - buyer beware -
etc.}! If you happen to find errors or anomalies, please take the time to log an issue on github
(\url{https://github.com/shimpe/rev2/issues}) or to suggest improvements. On \url{https://github.com/shimpe/sc-prophet-rev2} you
can find all the supercollider code you need to recreate this book yourself, or which you can use to automatically
generate sheets from your own patches (and a lot more, too!). The system, however, currently is mostly aimed at advanced
computer users. If you feel like improving on the system, I will of course gladly accept suggestions and/or patches to
improve either the \LaTeX{} template, or the overall system. 
    
And now, enough blah-blah, time for boom-boom.
